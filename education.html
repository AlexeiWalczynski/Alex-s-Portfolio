      <h1>Louisiana State University</h1>
      <p>I've been enrolled at LSU for around two and a half years now, coming upon my junior year status soon. This is because before the pandemic, I went to a different school, then transferred back home during COVID. My major is biomedical engineering with a focus and emphasis on biomimetics and prosthesis, and what biomimetics means exactly is the field of creating machines or robots that have high compatibility with humans. Think of this like power-lifting equipment that wouldn't also crush the human wearer, similar to <em>Iron Man</em> and his armor. Or more precisely, machinery that imitates nature to increase its innate bio-compatibility, sustainability, and maintenance efficiency by using meshes of biological materials and structures when applied to mechanical components.</p>
