    <h1>Writing, Gaming & Creativity</h1>
    <p>This section could perhaps be more accurately titled, 'My Personal Ode to Hidetaka Miyazaki', or 'How Much I Love Cosmic Horror'. The video game <em>Bloodborne</em> has a very special place in my heart: it is supposedly a Gothic horror, set in the werewolf-afflicted city of Yharnam. However, as the protagonist continues to progress through the game, the world is revealed to not be as it seems, with horrifying creatures lurking thinly beyond the veil of our reality, more incomprehensible than simple wolf-like beastmen. As the city is bathed in madness, the red moon descends, revealing the misbegotten Great Ones-- the inhuman deities of Yharnam, beckoned by man, to commune. Ultimately, man is the harbinger of his own doom, and were he more quiet, he would have gone unnoticed. These, of course, are all tropes commonly associated with the genre of cosmic horror- man's quest for knowledge, self-destruction, the interference of unknown and difficult-to-understand beings from different realms. Hidetaka Miyazaki's <em>Bloodborne</em> is my first real experience with the genre, leading me to delve into the works of H.P. Lovecraft, and other authors and creators in the genre.</p>

    <p>My main hobby that I indulge in for fun, aside from playing these wonderful games, is writing. I enjoy writing stories inspired by the books I've read, or games that I've played, and even enjoy trying to create my own tabletop game.</p>
