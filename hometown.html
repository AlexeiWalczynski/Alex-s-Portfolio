    <h1>Mandeville, Louisiana</h1>
    <p>Located on the northshore of New Orleans, Mandeville is where I grew up. Pictured above is a sunset view of the Northshore Lakefront, which spans the coast, with the New Orleans causeway in view. Though I grew up here and have lived most of my life here, I have also lived in places such as Duluth and Minneapolis, both in Minnesota. My family originates from there.</p>
