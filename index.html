    <p>Coming all the way from Mandeville to Baton Rouge, I'm a student at LSU and BRCC too! My concentration is in biological engineering, though with a focus on mechanical- think of like prosthetic limbs or robotics. I'm pursuing a minor in computer science because it integrates well with my field, and is heavily recommended. Half my family lives in Minnesota, and the other half down here. I design tabletop games in my free time and sometimes play video games, with my absolute favorite being the game <em>Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice</em>, which is where my personal motto comes from. Hesitation is defeat! I really do enjoy being active though, and my favorite physical activity would be running along the local lakefront. Hope we get to know each other just a little better!
